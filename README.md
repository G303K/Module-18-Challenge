## Description

This application is a homework assignment for the MSU Coding Bootcamp.
In this challange we were tasked with building an API for a network application
where users can interact with eachother.

Users will be able to connect to a database using MongoDB.

IF I execute the command to launch the application,
THEN the server initiates, and the Mongoose models synchronize with the MongoDB database.

WHEN I access API GET routes using Insomnia for users and thoughts,
THEN the data for each of these routes is presented in a well-formatted JSON.

WHEN I assess API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia,
THEN I can effectively create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the database.

IF I examine API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia,
THEN I can successfully generate and delete reactions to thoughts, as well as add and remove friends from a userâ€™s friend list.
